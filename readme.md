# Vision

To master leet in the most time and memory effecient manner. Imagine a tree 

# Concept Map

Choose memoization to traverse/manipulate while traversing/manipulating OG

- Data Structure Characteristics
  - array/string: stack/queue, ordered set, prefix sum, sorted, suffix array | two Pointers/iterator(sliding window) Enumeration
  - graph: heap, strongly/bi/uni-connected component, eulerian | BFS/DFS
  - hash: 
- problem types
  - sorting: sorting algorithms, 
  - search: shortest path, binary search, 


# Concept List

- Implementations: Two Pointers/iterator(Sliding Window) Enumeration, Counting?
  - Array/String: string matching, Suffix Array
  - Hash Table: Hash Function, Rolling Hash
  - graphs: Shortest Path, Strongly Connected Component, Biconnected Component
  - Linked List, Doubly-Linked List
- Divide and counqour (with/without greedy/backtracking): dp or recursion
